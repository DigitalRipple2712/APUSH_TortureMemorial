          <p><strong>Unfortunately, </strong> even today, there isn't enough funding to construct the memorial for torture survivors and victims</p>
          <p>Lori Lightfoot didn't follow through with her plan of funding it in her first 100 days in office.</p>
		  <p>Fortunately, her administration has planned to follow through with the memorial following the George Floyd protests. They inform us if funding continues, construction will begin by the end of the year.

          <p><strong>Jon Graham Burge (December 20, 1947 â€“ September 19, 2018) </strong> was a decorated Vietnam War Veteran as well as a detective. He was accused of torturing over 100 African American Chicagoans between 1972 and 1991. He was the commander of the Torture Squad, a group of officers who's main goals were to extract confessions from the accused. Most of the so-called accused were African American while Burge was white. Some agree that racism played a large role in this scandal. While it was not directly stated, it can be inferred.</p>
		  <br>
          <p><b>Major Event Timeline:</b> <br><br>1993 - Burge was terminated from the CPD (Chicago Police Department)<br>2010 - Burge was charged with the obstruction of justice and spent nearly 5 years in jail <br>2014 - Released to house arrest <br> 2015 - Released from house arrest <br> 2018 - Burge passes away 2 days after the trial of another convicted police officer</p>

          <p><strong>Unfortunately, </strong> around 19 potential survivors remain falsely imprisoned.</p>
          <p>The torture squad was mainly functioning in the South Side of Chicago, where the population was mainly of African Americans. This would be an example of institutional racism.</p>
		  <p>The amount of pain and torture these civilians went through just to falsely confess and be imprisoned is too much to be put in words.

          <p><strong>0 apologies from Jon Burge.</strong> Even after being convicted and sent to prison, Bruge still hasn't apologized a single time.</p>
          <p>Burge's case cost millions of taxpayers dollars and 25 other detectives were allegedly involved in this ring. 26 other detectives who were most likely also in the ring are supposedly free on the streets today.</p>
